# Player motivation and progression

Identify what your playerâ€™s core motivation is and how the player progresses.

# Motivations

**Primary motivation**

What is your playerâ€™s primary motivation? What thing drives them in life? (See the talks and pdf in further reading for examples.)

**Secondary motivations**

What other motivations drive your player, if any.

# Progression

How does the core action in the game support your playerâ€™s primary motivation?

For example:

**Harvest materials**

The player can harvest materials from around them.

**Build better tools and equipment**

The player can use the harvested materials to build better tools and equipment.

**Explore further into the unknown**

The better tools and equipment allows them to explore more distant places without dying.

**Achieve a fulfilling sense of discovery**

Exploring more distant places can fill the player with a sense of discovery and achievement.
