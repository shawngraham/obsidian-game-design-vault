# Game loops

In here write down your game loops. What does your player do moment by moment?

# Core game loop

For example:

**Navigate a maze**

The player can move up, down, left or right in a maze.

**Avoid ghosts**

The player has to avoid ghosts that follow them in the maze.

**Clear the dots in the maze**

The player eats dots as they move around the maze.
