[Jeremiah McCall](https://gamingthepast.net/) has developed a framework for analyzing historical games called the 'Historical Problem Space Framework.' An article discussing his ideas in some depth is available [here](https://jgeekstudies.org/2019/04/22/playing-with-the-past-history-and-video-games-and-why-it-might-matter/)

‘Playing with the Past: History and Video Games (and Why It Might Matter)’. _Journal of Geek Studies_, 23 Apr. 2019, https://jgeekstudies.org/2019/04/22/playing-with-the-past-history-and-video-games-and-why-it-might-matter/.

Use the HPSF as a kind of check on your design: what kind of historical experience have you designed? What historical perspectives have you built into your experience? What historical thinking are you asking your player to perform?

Use the headings below, or turn each heading into a new note (highlight the text, open the command palette, 'note composer: extract selection'). You could make a copy of the [[Empty HPSF diagram]] and add text directly to it. 

## Genre
