The original game design template was by Rosa Carbo-Mascarell | [Notion](https://glamorous-save-06a.notion.site/Game-design-template-0132383574dd4c2dbff5d14e3a90761c) This version was created for Shawn Graham's fall 2022 class, 'HIST3812 Playful Engagement with the Past' at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca) It was ported to Obsidian, and then a few extra features included to help with the planning of 'history' games, broadly imagined.

Hit the 'pencil' button, top-right, to edit any note. Hit the 'doc' button, same location, to view the rendered markdown version of the page. 'Live preview' is turned off, since it interferes with the theme. This vault uses the minimal theme so that images in the [[Art Style Notes|art style]] folder can be arranged as a grid.

You can have multiple notes open at once; every note or interface element can be dragged to a new location on the page. When you get things arranged the way you like, you can open the command palette and save this 'workspace'. You can save several different workspaces, and reload any of them.

## Enhancements

Excalidraw is installed in this vault, to enable the drawing of mind maps, character or level sketches, and so on. Open the command palette, search for 'excalidraw'. Text in an excalidraw drawing can be linked to notes using the normal syntax of `[[` and `]]`. 

The kanban plugin is installed for some basic project management and task organization. One board is already [[Testing Plan Kanban|present]]. Click to drag a card from one column to another. Look for 'kanban' on the command palette to make a new board.

If the dataview plugin is installed, various notes could be reformatted so that they use key:value pairs to describe critical information. Then, one could build a note featuring dataview queries that pull the information together from across the vault. 

One might want to explore the various [Zotero](https://zotero.org) integration plugins. 

The [tag navigator](https://github.com/alexobenauer/obsidian-tag-navigator) plugin (not yet in the Community plugins) might be of value for some users. It creates a 'tag navigator' page that groups tags and subtags to give another perspective on the vault and a way to navigate through it.

## Creating a single document for Word etc from this vault

This is a note taking app, not a long-form writing app. Nevertheless, there are a variety of ways one might do this. 

Take a look at the 'Longform' plugin (in the community plugins) might be one solution.

Another might be to install Pandoc on your machine, then use one of the Pandoc plugins to export directly from the source markdown to word, pdf, html. The various pandoc plugins give guidance on where to get pandoc and how to install it on your computer, and then how to get the plugin to use it.

The simplest method might be to create a new note - call it output-doc, say - embed the other notes or blocks within notes output-doc, and then click the preview button. Then copy the entire page and paste it into Word. Yes, the formatting might be a bit wonky, but that's what Word is for.
